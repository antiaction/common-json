antiaction-common-json
======================

Java JSON library

A compact library to un/-marshall JSON streams to/from objects/representations.

## Usage ##

* JSON stream <> JSON structure <> Java objects.
* JSON stream <> Java objects.

Using JSON structures is more flexible depending on ones requirements.
Converting directly between streams and objects is the fastest.

## Support ##

Java types supported:
* Null
* Boolean/boolean
* Integer/int
* Long/long
* Float/float
* Double/double
* BigInteger
* BigDecimal
* String
* Byte[]/byte[]
* Array[<..>]

And partial support for
* Byte/byte
* Character/char
* java.util.Date
* java.sql.Timestamp
* List<..>
* Map<String, ..>
* Set<..>

## Roadmap ##

* Check how json values not mapped are handled.
* Omit null values from json output.
* Add full support for Set<..>, Map<..> and List<..>.
* Add support for converters in JSON stream <> Java objects (un)marshalling.
* Add full support for more primitive types and their object counterparts.
* Improve code coverage.

## History ##

### version 0.7.0 ###

More work on improving object to/from stream marshaller/unmarshaller.

* Improve code coverage in com.antiaction.common.json.representation package.
* Throws JSONException those places where IllegalStateException were thrown.
* Added support for byte, Byte, char, Character, java.util.Date and java.sql.Timestamp fields in stream (un)marshaller.
* Added support for forcing nullable of fields directly in the JSONObjectMappings class.
* Added support for overriding ignore annotations directly in the JSONObjectMappings class.
* Added support for mapping interface collection field types.
* Added @JSONInstanceType annotation to support mapping interface collection field types.
* Added support for stream (un)marshalling of List<..> instances.
* Minor additions to JSONObjectMappings to support List<..> (un)marshalling.
* Unit tests and bug fix to JSONObjectMappings/JSONObjectMapping/JSONObjectFieldMapping toString().

### version 0.6.0 ###
Released: 2015-01-24

Work on improving object to/from stream marshaller/unmarshaller.

* Added support for array fields in JSON stream <> Java objects (un)marshalling.

* Code coverage at 81.3%.

### version 0.5.0 ###
Released: 2013-11-16

Work on implementing object to/from stream marshaller/unmarshaller.

### version 0.2.0 ###
Released: 2012-12-05

Work on the JSON structure to Object mapper.
Comprehensive unit testing of the Object mapper.

* Added some annotations for nullable, ignore and json.
